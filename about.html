                        I was born and raised in Lima, Peru.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        I have always been creative, persistent, and driven. As a very motivated and high achieving individual, I moved to the US in 2017 in order to expand my education options.  This has been a life-changing experience, which opened the doors to a completely new reality of opportunities.
                        <br><br>
                        A special thank you to my family especially to my mom Lucy, my dad Pepe and my brother Jeffrey, for always being there and making all of this possible :)
